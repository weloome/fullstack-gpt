       "[Document(page_content=\"PART ONE\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\\n\\nWinston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the\\n\\nvile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,\\n\\nthough not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering\\n\\nalong with him.\\n\\nThe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a\\n\\ncoloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.\\n\\nIt depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a\\n\\nman of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome\\n\\nfeatures. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even\\n\\nat the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric\\n\\ncurrent was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive\\n\\nin preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,\\n\\nwho was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went\\n\\nslowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the\\n\\nlift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was\\n\\none of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about\\n\\nwhen you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\\n\\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had\\n\\nsomething to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an\\n\\noblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface\\n\\nof the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank\\n\\nsomewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument\\n\\n(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of\\n\\nshutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail\\n\\nfigure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls\\n\\nwhich were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face\\n\\nnaturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor\\n\\nblades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\\n\\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in\\n\\nthe street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into\\n\\n\\n\\nspirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there\\n\\nseemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered\\n\\neverywhere. The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding\\n\\ncorner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER\\n\\nIS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into\\n\\nWinston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,\\n\\nflapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the\\n\\nsingle word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between\\n\\nthe roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again\\n\\nwith a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's\\n\\nwindows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police\\n\\nmattered.\\n\\nBehind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away\\n\\nabout pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The\\n\\ntelescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston\\n\\nmade, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,\\n\\nmoreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal\\n\\nplaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course\\n\\nno way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How\\n\\noften, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual\\n\\nwire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all\\n\\nthe time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted\\n\\nto. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the\\n\\nassumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in\\n\\ndarkness, every movement scrutinized.\\n\\nWinston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he\\n\\nwell knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of\\n\\nTruth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.\\n\\nThis, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chief\\n\\ncity of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of\\n\\nOceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him\\n\\nwhether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these\\n\\nvistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with\\n\\nbaulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs\\n\\nwith corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?\\n\\nAnd the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the\\n\\nwillow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the\\n\\nbombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies\\n\\nof wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not\\n\\nremember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit\\n\\ntableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official\\n\\nlanguage of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see\\n\\nAppendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It\\n\\nwas an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring\\n\\nup, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston\\n\\nstood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in\\n\\nelegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:\\n\\n  WAR IS PEACE\\n\\n  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\\n\\n  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\n\\nThe Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above\\n\\nground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London\\n\\nthere were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So\\n\\ncompletely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof\\n\\nof Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They\\n\\nwere the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus\\n\\nof government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself\\n\\nwith news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of\\n\\nPeace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which\\n\\nmaintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible\\n\\nfor economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,\\n\\nand Miniplenty.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows\\n\\nin it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor\\n\\nwithin half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except\\n\\non official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of\\n\\nbarbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even\\n\\nthe streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced\\n\\nguards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.\\n\\nWinston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the\\n\\nexpression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing\\n\\nthe telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving\\n\\nthe Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the\\n\\ncanteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except\\n\\na hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's\\n\\nbreakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid\\n\\n\\n\\nwith a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily\\n\\nsmell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,\\n\\nnerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.\\n\\nInstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The\\n\\nstuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the\\n\\nsensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The\\n\\nnext moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world\\n\\nbegan to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet\\n\\nmarked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the\\n\\ntobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful.\\n\\nHe went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood\\n\\nto the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a\\n\\npenholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a\\n\\nred back and a marbled cover.\\n\\nFor some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual\\n\\nposition. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where\\n\\nit could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the\\n\\nwindow. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston\\n\\nwas now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been\\n\\nintended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well\\n\\nback, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so\\n\\nfar as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed\\n\\nin his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual\\n\\ngeography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now\\n\\nabout to do.\\n\\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of\\n\\nthe drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,\\n\\na little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for\\n\\nat least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much\\n\\nolder than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little\\n\\njunk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not\\n\\nnow remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire\\n\\nto possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops\\n\\n('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not\\n\\nstrictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and\\n\\nrazor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He\\n\\nhad given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside\\n\\nand bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious\\n\\nof wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home\\n\\nin his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising\\n\\n\\n\\npossession.\\n\\nThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal\\n\\n(nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected\\n\\nit was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least\\n\\nby twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into\\n\\nthe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic\\n\\ninstrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,\\n\\nfurtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the\\n\\nbeautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead\\n\\nof being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing\\n\\nby hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything\\n\\ninto the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present\\n\\npurpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a\\n\\nsecond. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the\\n\\ndecisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:\\n\\n   April 4th, 1984.\\n\\nHe sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To\\n\\nbegin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It\\n\\nmust be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was\\n\\nthirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but\\n\\nit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.\\n\\nFor whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?\\n\\nFor the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the\\n\\ndoubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the\\n\\nNewspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he had\\n\\nundertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It\\n\\nwas of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present,\\n\\nin which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,\\n\\nand his predicament would be meaningless.\\n\\nFor some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had\\n\\nchanged over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed\\n\\nnot merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have\\n\\nforgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks\\n\\npast he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed\\n\\nhis mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing\\n\\nwould be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable\\n\\n\\n\\nrestless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for\\n\\nyears. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover\\n\\nhis varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it,\\n\\nbecause if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking\\n\\nby. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front\\n\\nof him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music,\\n\\nand a slight booziness caused by the gin.\\n\\nSuddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what\\n\\nhe was setting down. His small but childish handwriting straggled up and\\n\\ndown the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its\\n\\nfull stops:\\n\\n   April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good\\n\\none of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean.\\n\\nAudience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away\\n\\nwith a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the\\n\\nwater like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights,\\n\\nthen he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as\\n\\nsuddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with\\n\\nlaughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a\\n\\nhelicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been\\n\\na jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in\\n\\nher arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her\\n\\nbreasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting\\n\\nher arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright\\n\\nherself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought\\n\\nher arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20\\n\\nkilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.\\n\\nthen there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up\\n\\ninto the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it\\n\\nup and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in\\n\\nthe prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting\\n\\nthey didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint\\n\\nright not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her\\n\\nout i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles\\n\\nsay typical prole reaction they never----\\n\\nWinston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did\\n\\nnot know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious\\n\\nthing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had\\n\\n\\n\\nclarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to\\n\\nwriting it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident\\n\\nthat he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.\\n\\nIt had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could\\n\\nbe said to happen.\\n\\nIt was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston\\n\\nworked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them\\n\\nin the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for\\n\\nthe Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the\\n\\nmiddle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken\\n\\nto, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often\\n\\npassed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she\\n\\nworked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seen\\n\\nher with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job\\n\\non one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of\\n\\nabout twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic\\n\\nmovements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was\\n\\nwound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to\\n\\nbring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the\\n\\nvery first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the\\n\\natmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general\\n\\nclean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked\\n\\nnearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always\\n\\nthe women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted\\n\\nadherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and\\n\\nnosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression\\n\\nof being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor\\n\\nshe gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into\\n\\nhim and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even\\n\\ncrossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That,\\n\\nit was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar\\n\\nuneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever\\n\\nshe was anywhere near him.\\n\\nThe other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and\\n\\nholder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim\\n\\nidea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people\\n\\nround the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member\\n\\napproaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,\\n\\nhumorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a\\n\\ncertain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on\\n\\n\\n\\nhis nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously\\n\\ncivilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such\\n\\nterms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his\\n\\nsnuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many\\n\\nyears. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued\\n\\nby the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's\\n\\nphysique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps\\n\\nnot even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was\\n\\nnot perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,\\n\\nperhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but\\n\\nsimply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a\\n\\nperson that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and\\n\\nget him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this\\n\\nguess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced\\n\\nat his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently\\n\\ndecided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was\\n\\nover. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.\\n\\nA small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was\\n\\nbetween them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.\\n\\nThe next moment a hideous, grinding screech, as of some monstrous machine\\n\\nrunning without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.\\n\\nIt was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the\\n\\nback of one's neck. The Hate had started.\\n\\nAs usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had\\n\\nflashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the\\n\\naudience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and\\n\\ndisgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago\\n\\n(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading\\n\\nfigures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and\\n\\nthen had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned\\n\\nto death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes\\n\\nof the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in\\n\\nwhich Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,\\n\\nthe earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against\\n\\nthe Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,\\n\\nsprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still\\n\\nalive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,\\n\\nunder the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was\\n\\noccasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.\\n\\nWinston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face,\\n\\nwith a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--a\\n\\nclever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile\\n\\nsilliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles\\n\\nwas perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a\\n\\nsheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack\\n\\nupon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that\\n\\na child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible\\n\\nenough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less\\n\\nlevel-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big\\n\\nBrother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding\\n\\nthe immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom\\n\\nof speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,\\n\\nhe was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all\\n\\nthis in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the\\n\\nhabitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak\\n\\nwords: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally\\n\\nuse in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to\\n\\nthe reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on\\n\\nthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--row\\n\\nafter row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam\\n\\nup to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others\\n\\nexactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the\\n\\nbackground to Goldstein's bleating voice.\\n\\nBefore the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable\\n\\nexclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.\\n\\nThe self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power\\n\\nof the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,\\n\\nthe sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger\\n\\nautomatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia\\n\\nor Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was\\n\\ngenerally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although\\n\\nGoldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a\\n\\nthousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,\\n\\nin books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the\\n\\ngeneral gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,\\n\\nhis influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes\\n\\nwaiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs\\n\\nacting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.\\n\\nHe was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of\\n\\nconspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its\\n\\nname was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible\\n\\n\\n\\nbook, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author\\n\\nand which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a\\n\\ntitle. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew\\n\\nof such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor\\n\\nTHE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if\\n\\nthere was a way of avoiding it.\\n\\nIn its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and\\n\\ndown in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort\\n\\nto drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little\\n\\nsandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and\\n\\nshutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.\\n\\nHe was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and\\n\\nquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The\\n\\ndark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'\\n\\nand suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the\\n\\nscreen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued\\n\\ninexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the\\n\\nothers and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The\\n\\nhorrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to\\n\\nact a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining\\n\\nin. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous\\n\\necstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash\\n\\nfaces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of\\n\\npeople like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into\\n\\na grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an\\n\\nabstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to\\n\\nanother like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred\\n\\nwas not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against\\n\\nBig Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his\\n\\nheart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian\\n\\nof truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he\\n\\nwas at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein\\n\\nseemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big\\n\\nBrother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an\\n\\ninvincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes\\n\\nof Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and\\n\\nthe doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister\\n\\nenchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure\\n\\nof civilization.\\n\\nIt was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that\\n\\nby a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one\\n\\n\\n\\nwrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded\\n\\nin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired\\n\\ngirl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.\\n\\nHe would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked\\n\\nto a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would\\n\\nravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before,\\n\\nmoreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because\\n\\nshe was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with\\n\\nher and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which\\n\\nseemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious\\n\\nscarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.\\n\\nThe Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual\\n\\nsheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.\\n\\nThen the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed\\n\\nto be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and\\n\\nseeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the\\n\\npeople in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But\\n\\nin the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the\\n\\nhostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,\\n\\nblack-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that\\n\\nit almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.\\n\\nIt was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are\\n\\nuttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but\\n\\nrestoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big\\n\\nBrother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood\\n\\nout in bold capitals:\\n\\n  WAR IS PEACE\\n\\n  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\\n\\n  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\n\\nBut the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the\\n\\nscreen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was\\n\\ntoo vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung\\n\\nherself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a\\n\\ntremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her arms\\n\\ntowards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent\\n\\nthat she was uttering a prayer.\\n\\nAt this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,\\n\\n\\n\\nrhythmical chant of 'B-B!...B-B!'--over and over again, very slowly, with a\\n\\nlong pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,\\n\\nsomehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the\\n\\nstamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as\\n\\nthirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in\\n\\nmoments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom\\n\\nand majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,\\n\\na deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.\\n\\nWinston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could\\n\\nnot help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of\\n\\n'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the\\n\\nrest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to\\n\\ncontrol your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive\\n\\nreaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the\\n\\nexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was\\n\\nexactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,\\n\\nit did happen.\\n\\nMomentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken\\n\\noff his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with\\n\\nhis characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when\\n\\ntheir eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, he\\n\\nKNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable\\n\\nmessage had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the\\n\\nthoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I am\\n\\nwith you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what you\\n\\nare feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.\\n\\nBut don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligence\\n\\nwas gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.\\n\\nThat was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such\\n\\nincidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him\\n\\nthe belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the\\n\\nParty. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after\\n\\nall--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite\\n\\nof the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the\\n\\nBrotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days\\n\\nnot. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything\\n\\nor nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory\\n\\nwalls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand\\n\\nwhich had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all\\n\\nguesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his\\n\\ncubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their\\n\\n\\n\\nmomentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably\\n\\ndangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two\\n\\nseconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of\\n\\nthe story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in\\n\\nwhich one had to live.\\n\\nWinston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin\\n\\nwas rising from his stomach.\\n\\nHis eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly\\n\\nmusing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was\\n\\nno longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid\\n\\nvoluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--\\n\\n  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\n\\n  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\n\\n  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\n\\n  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\n\\n  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\n\\nover and over again, filling half a page.\\n\\nHe could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the\\n\\nwriting of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial\\n\\nact of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the\\n\\nspoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.\\n\\nHe did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he\\n\\nwrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, made\\n\\nno difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go\\n\\non with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the\\n\\nsame. He had committed--would still have committed, even if he had never\\n\\nset pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself.\\n\\nThoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be\\n\\nconcealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for\\n\\nyears, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.\\n\\nIt was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night. The\\n\\nsudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights\\n\\nglaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast\\n\\nmajority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People\\n\\n\\n\\nsimply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the\\n\\nregisters, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your\\n\\none-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished,\\n\\nannihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.\\n\\nFor a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in a\\n\\nhurried untidy scrawl:\\n\\n   theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i\\n\\ndont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the\\n\\nneck i dont care down with big brother----\\n\\nHe sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down\\n\\nthe pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at\\n\\nthe door.\\n\\nAlready! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was\\n\\nmight go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated.\\n\\nThe worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like a\\n\\ndrum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got\\n\\nup and moved heavily towards the door.\", metadata={'source': './files/chapter_one.docx'})]"
